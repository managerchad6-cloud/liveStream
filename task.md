Cursor Instructions — MVP Chatbox → OpenAI Agent
Goal

Build a minimal MVP that lets me:

Open a webpage

Type a message in a chatbox

Submit it

Receive a response generated by the OpenAI API

This is NOT a chatbot product yet — it is a developer test UI.

No authentication.
No moderation.
No ElevenLabs audio output yet.
Just text in → text out.

Environment

Environment variables already exist:

OPENAI_API_KEY

MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

PORT=3000

Use them as-is.
Do not hardcode secrets.

Tech Constraints (keep it simple)

Single backend server

Single frontend page

JSON over HTTP

No database

No state persistence

No streaming required (plain request/response is fine)

If you need to choose defaults:

Backend: Node.js

Frontend: simple HTML + minimal JS (no framework required)

Backend Responsibilities
1. Expose a single endpoint
POST /chat


Input (JSON):

{
  "message": "string"
}


Output (JSON):

{
  "reply": "string"
}

2. OpenAI Call Rules

Use the OpenAI API

Use the model defined in MODEL

Treat the user input as a chat message

Always return some reply (no selective logic yet)

No function calling

No tools

No memory

No system complexity

This is a raw baseline.

3. Prompt Behavior (important)

The agent should behave like:

A livestream host responding casually in chat.

Guidelines:

Short responses

Conversational

Not verbose

No emojis required

No markdown

No explanations about being an AI

You may use a simple fixed system prompt to enforce tone.

Frontend Responsibilities
1. Single Page UI

The page must include:

A text input (chatbox)

A submit button

A message history area

No styling requirements beyond “readable”.

2. Behavior

User types a message

Clicks submit (or presses Enter)

Message is sent to /chat

The reply is displayed below

Do not worry about:

typing indicators

timestamps

usernames

avatars

scrolling polish

Non-Goals (Do NOT implement)

No voice playback

No ElevenLabs usage yet

No animation

No moderation logic

No message filtering

No selective response logic

No Pump.fun integration

This is pure plumbing.

File Expectations

At minimum, produce:

A backend entry file (server.js, index.js, or similar)

A static frontend file (index.html)

Clear instructions on how to run locally

Success Criteria

I can:

Run the server

Open localhost:3000

Type a message

Get a text reply from OpenAI

That’s it.

Notes for Cursor

Favor clarity over cleverness

Keep everything readable

Assume this will be extended later into:

voice output

selective responses

moderation

livestream integration

This MVP is just the foundation.
