# Cursor Rules for LiveStream Project

## Git Workflow
After completing any task or making changes:
1. Always stage all changes: `git add .`
2. Commit with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
3. Push to remote: `git push origin master`

## Auto-commit Pattern
When the user asks me to complete a task, I should:
1. Complete the task
2. Automatically commit and push changes unless the user explicitly asks not to
3. Use clear, descriptive commit messages

## Commit Message Format
- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Be specific about what changed
- Examples:
  - "Add voice selection dropdown"
  - "Fix audio playback error handling"
  - "Update UI styling for mobile"
  - "Refactor server error handling"
